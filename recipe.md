Ingredients
4-5 Potatoes peeled and cut into fingers (medium)
Oil for deep frying
First Coating:
2 teaspoon Chilli powder
1 teaspoon Garlic Paste
1 teaspoon Red Chilli Paste
3 tablespoon Corn Flour
3 tablespoon All Purpose Flour
2 teaspoon Salt
Second Coating:
3 tablespoon All Purpose Flour
3 tablespoon Corn Flour
1/4 teaspoon Black Pepper
2-3 tablespoon Water
For the Sauce:
2 tablespoon Oil
1 tablespoon Garlic finely chopped
1 teaspoon Red Chilli Flakes
3 tablespoon White Sesame Seeds
1 teaspoon Vinegar
1 teaspoon Soy Sauce
2 tablespoon Tomato Ketchup
1 1/2 tablespoon Honey
1 teaspoon Red Chilli Paste
1/4 cup Water + 1 teaspoon Corn Flour mixed to make a slurry
2 tablespoon Spring Onion chopped (green part only)
Instructions

Wash potato fingers well in running water and set aside. This removes any extra starch in the potatoes.
Mix together corn flour, all purpose flour, chilli powder, chilli paste and salt. Coat the potato fingers evenly with this flour mix. Heat oil in a wok or karahi and deep fry the potato fingers in batches till the potato is half cooked. It's important that you drop one potato finger at a time in to the oil so that they don't stick together (watch video above to see how to do this). Remove the potato fingers on a tissue lined plate and let them cool.
For the second coating, make a medium thick batter with all purpose flour, corn flour and pepper powder by adding just a few tablespoons of water. Dip the half done fries in this batter and fry again in hot oil till crisp and golden. Drain on a kitchen paper and keep aside.
Heat 2 tablespoons oil in another wok, add chopped garlic and stir fry for a few seconds. Add chili flakes and sesame seeds and saute for another minute to toast them. Now add vinegar, soy sauce, ketchup, honey and the red chili paste and stir together. Mix corn flour with 1/4 cup water to make a slurry and add this to the honey- vinegar mixture in the wok and stir for a few seconds till it thickens.
Add the fried potato fingers and spring onion greens and toss together so that they are coated evenly in sauce. Switch off the flame and serve immediately garnished with some more sesame seeds and spring onion greens.
Notes
You may adjust the quantity of honey as per your taste
Its important to cut the potato fingers evenly so that they cook evenly
You will need approximately two cups oil for deep frying, and you can use the same oil for the second frying
A wok is the best way to coat the potatoes in sauce, because it provides enough space to toss them around, but if you don't have one, feel free to use a frying pan
